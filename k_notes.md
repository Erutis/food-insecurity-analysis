Columns to keep: 

2019 = 
2010 = 

Both = censustract, state, county, 



Seems like there's errors in the population for at least 6 of the counties, they have over 100% SNAP recipients. Four NaNs too. 


Should make normalized df using pop2010 on each metric. 


Will exclude anything with population > 8,000
